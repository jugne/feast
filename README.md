feast:  Tasty additions to BEAST 2
==================================

This is a small [BEAST 2](http://www.beast2.org) package which
contains additions to the core functionality.  The common thread
which connects these additions is that they all work to increase
the flexibility of BEAST and to empower users to set up a broader
range of analyses without needing to write additional Java code.

You won't find new models here, but you will find different
ways to combine existing models and make certain tasks easier.
